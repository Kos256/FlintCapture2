make a small achievements tab on main app
subheading on that page: "Do silly things, get silly achievements... ;)"

and also make that tab greyed out until the user triggers an achievement
maybe make that subheading a tooltip too

make it so that you can choose between the screenshot image handler:
1. native windows screenshot
or
2. FlintCapture screenshoter

add the ability to change the main folder from AppData/Local/FlintCapture/ to any custom location and handle it in 3 cases:
1. make a new folder at new location, migrate existing data to new location
2. if data seems to be empty, just choose the new folder without migrating
3. if there is data in current folder AND new folder, ask user to:
- attempt to transfer whatever it can into the new folder
- skip and let the user transfer themselves manually

make the crop box draggable from the middle to move the entire selection

add feedback (a small notification) that tells user that flint capture is running

change in NotificationWindow intro animation:
- don't animate Left property of window
- instead animate margin property of its RootGrid

when you start annotating with a drawing tablet for thr first time:
popup, "if you don't want pressure sensitivity affecting your annotations, you can disable it __here__"

make a timer function that snaps the screenshot after a few seconds
