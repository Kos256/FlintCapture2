make a small achievements tab on main app
subheading on that page: "Do silly things, get silly achievements... ;)"

and also make that tab greyed out until the user triggers an achievement
maybe make that subheading a tooltip too

make it so that you can choose between the screenshot image handler:
1. native windows screenshot
or
2. FlintCapture screenshoter
