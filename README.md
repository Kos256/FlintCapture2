# FlintCapture 2.0.1
FlintCapture v1's codebase got out of hand, so I tried again with a new codebase. So don't be confused if you can't find v1, it's been replaced by v2 ;)
> [!NOTE]
> Despite the version being 2.x.x, <ins>**it is still very much an alpha build of FlintCapture**</ins>, so don't expect anything ✨ *finished n fancy* ✨ up until 2.2.x ¯\\_(ツ)\_/¯

# Features
**Here's what's currently supported in the image editor:**

## Cropping
The cropping feature is not entirely functional, but it does work mostly. It supports infinite cropping (down to 1x1 if you really want).
For now, only **two** of the corner handles work, which is the absolute minimum for cropping to function properly. But I will implement all 4 *soon*.

## Annotation
Annotation does not work for now. All I've implemented so far is an InkCanvas with a transparent background, but the strokes do not get translated to the image yet. This is my next goal.
